# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

1. I am more comfortable than I thought, but it still is a little tricky. I might run through the exercises provided in this assignment again to just get the flow down. I might also talk through it while I am doing it because I think explaining what is going will also help me.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

2. Surprisingly I had productive struggles and not unproductive struggles. Honestly, I feel like the way we have been building off previous knowledge helps to make the material make more sense. The provided video for this assignment also helped me a lot to visually see and hear what was going on!


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

3. As I said previously in another self-evaluation, I put my two weeks in earlier at my job so I had some time before Mod 1 to practice and digest everything from Mod 0. I have been taking notes and writing down things I still don’t totally get or want to practice more. I am excited to practice in my free time!

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

4. I don’t have any particular questions as of right now!
